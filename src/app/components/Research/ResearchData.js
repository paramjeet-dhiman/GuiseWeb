    title: `Incremental cluster validity index-guided online learning for performance and robustness to presentation order`,

    description: `In streaming data applications incoming samples are processed and discarded, therefore, intelligent decision-making is crucial for the performance of lifelong learning systems. In addition, the order in which samples arrive may heavily affect the performance of online incremental learners. The recently introduced incremental cluster validity indices (iCVIs) provide valuable aid in addressing
    such class of problems. Their primary use-case has been cluster quality monitoring; nonetheless, they have been very recently integrated in a streaming clustering method to assist the clustering task itself. In this context, the work presented here introduces the first adaptive resonance theory (ART)-based model that uses iCVIs for unsupervised and semi-supervised online learning. Moreover, it shows for the first time how
    to use iCVIs to regulate ART vigilance.`,

    title: `Accelerating and improving clustering using adaptive resonance theory predictive mapping and incremental cluster validity indices`,

    description: `This paper presents an adaptive resonance theory (ART) model for unsupervised learning, namely
    iCVI-ARTMAP, which uses incremental cluster validity indices (iCVIs) to drive the clustering process
    within an ART predictive mapping (ARTMAP) model. Incorporating iCVIs to the decision-making and
    many-to-one mapping capabilities of ARTMAP can improve the choices of clusters to which samples
    are incrementally assigned. These improvements are accomplished by intelligently performing the operations of swapping sample assignments between clusters, splitting and merging clusters, and caching
    the values of variables when iCVI values need to be recomputed.`,
